# **World Weather Analysis**

The world weather analysis challenge consisted of two parts. Part 1 first randomly generated data for around 500 cities from across the world and then assessed correlations between different weather indicators and the latitiude of the cities. The second part visualized the location of the cities on a map and then narrowed down the selection of cities by certain criteria and used the Geoapify API to find a hotel in each city.

### **Conclusions:**

Regarding the weather indicator analysis, one can determin that latitude and maximum temperature are strongly correlated. A correlation between latitude and humidity, latitude and cloudiness, and latitude and wind speed are too slight to draw definite conclusions.
